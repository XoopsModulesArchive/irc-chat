<h2 align="center">iRadio Module Manual</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>This module is a port of a PHP-Nuke module written by Rene Hart. It provides a block that will play streamed radio from one of a list of radio stations chosen by you.</p>
<p>The E-Xoops version has been modified to include configuration options accessible through the System Admin menu.</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>Should be completely straightforward. Just unzip into your site folder and remember to chmod the cache folder and files to 777 & 666.</p>
<p>In language files other than English some entries will need correction!</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>There is a short list of Internet radio providers held in a database. You will need to edit this list to include the stations you want to see on your site. See <a href='http://www.radio-locator.com' target='_blank'>The MIT Radio Locator</a> for a useful list.</p>
